# PRTG-Network-Monitor-for-Enterprise-Bandwidth-Monitoring-and-Alert-System
A fully implemented project using PRTG Network Monitor to track real-time bandwidth usage across core network interfaces, detect abnormal traffic spikes, and alert administrators. This project includes PRTG setup steps, sensor configuration, alerting rules, and bandwidth reporting all tailored for enterprise networks.
<In-Case>

- Monitor bandwidth usage on routers/switches.
- Detect overutilization or unexpected spikes.
- Set thresholds and trigger alerts (email/SMS).
- Generate historical reports for audits or optimization.

A network topology diagram is attached in comment section for illustrating the PRTG deployment.
